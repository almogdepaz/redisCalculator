this is my fist go project
i wrote a redis subscriber that listens for massages with 2 data types and an operator
and dose some sort of processing on the data.

this is where most of the important stuff happens 

"run(redisAdrr string, inputChannel string, outputChannel string,bufferSize int,handlers []Handler) "
receives the redis address input and output channel names the buffer size for the channel and an array of handlers

handler is an interface() that has two methods:
  apply(data commons.Input) string
  applysTo() string

when we receive the array of handlers we map the handler to the operator that corresponds with it,
when handling a message we get the correct handler from the map and we use apply on the data,
we send the res to the output channel. 

subscriber.go -> reads meesages from redis channel uses a handler that corresponds to the correct operator 

publisher.go  -> just an example to send some massegs to the calculator

to run the subscriber with a local redis server 
cd to subscriber dir and
"go run  main.go subscriber.go handlers.go  "redis://localhost:6379" input output"

(same for publisher)
